# Point-fix-method

The fixed point method applied to the resolution of nonlinear equations consists in developing an iterative scheme, in this case a converging sequence towards a fixed point x of a certain application g, this fixed point is in this case
the solution of the equation f(x)=0
If an equation f(x) = 0 is equivalent to another equation of the form g(x) = x, then the search for the zeros of f is reduced to that of the fixed points of g: g(α) = α.
